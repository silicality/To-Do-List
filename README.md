# To-Do-List
This repository contains a basic To-Do List application that is intentionally kept simple and minimal.
The goal of this project is not just to build a to-do app, but to create a real-world, challenge-based open-source project where contributors can gradually upgrade a basic implementation into a complete, production-ready application.

📌 Project Purpose

Most to-do list projects are either:

too simple (no real challenges), or

too complete (nothing meaningful to add)

This repository sits in between.

It provides a working foundation, but leaves many important features incomplete so contributors can:

learn by building

solve real engineering problems

practice open-source contribution workflows
